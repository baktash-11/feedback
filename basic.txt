State:
	State is basically just data and there two types of state, 
	components level state 
		are the data which is associate only one level of component(no other component need to use the data);
	app level state

how to set state 
	create a file FeedbackItem.JSX which will include the rating and feedback
	use _rfce to create the component.... 
	
	import the FeedbackItem to the app.
	have to make the rating and the text part of state ... 
	import {useState} from 'react' note: the hooks are started with use... 

	inside our function FeedbackItem.... 
		const[rating, setRating] = useState(7)
		note the default value is 7 and we have to pass 2 thing the name which is rating and function which is 
		setRating in brackets to update the rating
	we can remove the value with rating.
